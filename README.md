<p>
 I am a freelance Web Developer and UI/UX Designer. I had one of my clients from Malaysia that was impressed by me for a past work that 
 required some design fixes and UX features. He came to me for a project that involved the internal processes of their team. Basically, 
 they wanted to automate some of their tasks and to use a system that all of their team can share work and also create invoices for various
 tasks. He gave me a deadline of a MONTH! In that time, I was pretty unsure of the work required and the time it would take. I was also not
 much experienced in dealing with clients. I started the work with haste and without any planning or detailed analysis of requirements and 
 ended up with a junk of code that seemed hard to refactor plus the client had been putting a lot of pressure on me for the time wasted.
 Anyways, this code had never been used and now for me it's just a failed project that taught me many things and I feel if I can come across
 many projects like this(that are out of my range) this can teach me a lot of new things. Check out the code and see if it worth it or not.
 
 Firebase API:
 
 The Client API keys file is in <strong>src/client/db/config/</strong> and the server API key file should be included in
 <strong>src/server/firebase/</strong>
